# EX-05-Feature-Generation


## AIM
To read the given data and perform Feature Generation process and save the data to a file. 

# Explanation
Feature Generation (also known as feature construction, feature extraction or feature engineering) is the process of transforming features into new features that better relate to the target.
 

# ALGORITHM
### STEP 1
Read the given Data
### STEP 2
Clean the Data Set using Data Cleaning Process
### STEP 3
Apply Feature Generation techniques to all the feature of the data set
### STEP 4
Save the data to the file

# CODE

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import seaborn as sbn

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("/content/data.csv")

df1 = df.copy()

df1.head(5)
